# Kilo Code Coding Standards

## General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Follow language-specific best practices and conventions
- Prioritize simplicity and clarity over clever solutions
- Document complex logic and business rules

## Code Structure
- Keep functions small and focused on a single responsibility
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Organize code into logical modules/components
- Maintain consistent file naming conventions

## Documentation
- Include clear README files for all projects
- Document API endpoints and their usage
- Add inline comments for complex algorithms
- Keep documentation up-to-date with code changes

## Testing
- Write unit tests for critical business logic
- Include integration tests for API endpoints
- Maintain test coverage above 80%
- Use meaningful test descriptions

## Security
- Never commit sensitive data (API keys, passwords)
- Validate all user inputs
- Use environment variables for configuration
- Follow OWASP security guidelines
